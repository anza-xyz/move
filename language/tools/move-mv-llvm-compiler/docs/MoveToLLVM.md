# Move to llvm-ir compiler

Generates llvm-ir from move bytecode. It provides a bridge between move-bytecode and llvm.
It leverages the llvmâ€™s Rust C bindings (llvm-sys) and can support all targets llvm supports.
For example, it can generate eBPF or executable binaries.

## Goals of the compiler

- Retargettable move to llvm compiler

## Non-goals

-

## Components

- move-ir translator
- move-native runtime
- testing
- FFI

## Translation

All integer arithmetic types are [checked](https://move-language.github.io/move/integers.html#arithmetic) for narrowing, overflow and undefined behavior at runtime.

## Optimizations

TODO:

## Calling convention

TODO:

## Support for native function calls

- abort
- return
- assert
- debug_print

## FFI

- Checks before and after calling external functions

## Type information

- For Debugging
- TypeInfo in the binary
- Format of typeinfo

## Testing

- ir tests
- runnable tests

## Project stages

### Stage 1

- Lower Move bytecode to llvm-ir
  - Move bytecode docs [[binary-format](https://github.com/solana-labs/move/blob/main/language/move-binary-format/src/file_format.rs#L1107), [spec](https://github.com/solana-labs/move/blob/main/language/documentation/spec/vm.md)]
- Encode function arguments, returns to communicate with outside contracts using Borsh
  - [Intro](https://hexdocs.pm/borsh_serializer/readme.html), [Borsh serialization](https://solanacookbook.com/guides/serialization.html#setting-up-for-borsh-serialization)
- Add debug info to types.
- Add [BTF](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/blob/master/Documentation/bpf.rst) types to provide runtime type information
- Add definitions to bytecode keywords
  - Simple operations can be codegen in llvm itself  but high level operation can be just calls.
  - E.g., Lowering BorrowField (a move bytecode instruction) can be just a function call (with right set of parameter) that does the borrow as well as does runtime checks
  - The definitions maybe put in a rust library that is linked to the executable (see stage2)
- Testing
  - Unit
  - Github Hooks Integration to run pre-merge tests
